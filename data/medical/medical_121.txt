     The biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so EXTREMELY high and
increasing is that NATURAL methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still
being SYSTEMATICALLY IGNORED and SUPPRESSED by the MONEY-GRUBBING and POWER-
MONGERING "medical" establishment.
That's not the half of it.  Did you realize that all medical doctors have
now been replaced by aliens?
Yup.  By the way, what planet are you from, and once you got here, did
you encounter those prejudices against foreign medical graduates?
